## A Book I Almost Didn’t Read: We by Yevgeny Zamyatin

My boyfriend gave me We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, knowing I have a thing for dystopian stories. Still, I let the book sit on my desk for months before opening it. Maybe it was the weight of the genre, or the fear it wouldn’t live up to the others I love. But once I finally started reading it, I was pulled in much faster than I expected.

We is set in a hyper-rational future where people live in glass buildings, wear identical clothing, and have their lives scheduled down to the minute. Emotions are considered a disease, and even imagination is a threat to the perfect balance of the State. Everyone is known by a number, not a name (the protagonist is D-503, a mathematician and builder of a spacecraft called the Integral, designed to export their “perfect” society to other planets.)

Right away, I saw echoes of other dystopias I’ve read: Brave New World, 1984, Fahrenheit 451. But what struck me most about We was how early it was written, and yet how timeless it feels. I could sense how deeply it influenced those later books (maybe even Interstellar???) And while I’m kind of biased (I love stories about totalitarian regimes and their slow collapse), We felt different. Its language is stranger, more chaotic, more poetic. It's written like a series of journal entries, and D-503's mind slowly unravels in real time as he falls for the mysterious rebel I-330.

One small detail haunted me long after I closed the book: D-503's obsession with numbers and how he believes the universe is ruled by absolute logic. At one point, I started thinking about how humans can’t create truly random numbers. Even when we try, our minds fall into patterns. It’s like there's a tiny tyrant inside us, always trying to bring order to chaos. That made the world of We feel even more real, this desperate need to quantify everything, to believe that randomness and freedom are mistakes that can be corrected.

In the end, D-503 is forced to undergo an “operation” to remove his imagination. The rebellion fails (at least on the surface), and the State reasserts control. But that little image of the grass lingers. It reminds us that even under total control, something soft and stubborn still pushes upward. That maybe freedom is not an idea we build, but a force that grows on its own.

Reading We was both unsettling and familiar. I waited too long to read it, but I’m glad I finally did.

I just remembered something else that’s been sitting with me: the book’s view on racism and the human obsession with feeling special. There's this thread running through the story, that deep-rooted desire to believe our group, our system, our logic is superior. It reminded me how often that mindset fuels exclusion, hierarchy, and dehumanization in the real world. The One State frames its dominance as scientific and moral progress, but beneath it is the same old instinct to divide, to control, to claim authority over what is "right."

And then there’s that haunting moment with I-330, when she takes D-503’s hand for the frist time. In that moment, she makes him feel special. Not as a number, not as a function in a machine, but as a person. It’s such a small, intimate gesture, but it breaks something open in him. He carries that feeling all the way to the end, even after the operation, even after he insists he’s been cured. That quiet memory lingers, like the grass. It’s proof that something human slipped past all the equations.

And then there’s the book’s complex relationship with Christianity. It doesn't offer a direct critique, but it definitely echoes and twists religious themes, original sin becomes imagination, salvation is replaced by conformity, and the Benefactor feels like a cold, authoritarian god. I-330, the rebel, even tempts D-503 with forbidden knowledge. The story reframes Eden, but not as a place of harmony, it’s a sterile garden of equations. It made me think about how belief systems can be used both to liberate and to dominate, depending on who’s in control of the story.
